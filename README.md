# Taxi_Hotspot_and_proximity_recommendation_using_kmeans_clustering
Through this project, we try to predict the best possible way to find the number of hotspots feasible for taxis in a city. 
As input, we take the pickup pointâ€™s latitude and longitude as coordinates. Using these coordinates, we try to predict the regions, where there could be highest possibility of getting a taxi. 
Using this, the business can report the waiting spots/hot spots to be made. So that the customers can go to these hotspots to get a taxi booked. 
Along with this, the project can be further extended as an application, where based on customers current latitude and longitude, the model can recommend him/her the nearest hotspot.
